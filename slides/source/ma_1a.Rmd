#. frame Bob’s Ice Cream Business

- Bob just started his career as an entrepreneur by taking over a small ice cream truck

- The previous owner, Emma, drove to different locations each day and used a little blackboard, on which every morning she wrote down how much a portion of ice cream shall cost today

- Emma left Bob a small collection of sales data, in which she noted for each day $t$

  - the price $p_{t}$ she had set

  - the number of ice portions $q_{t}$ she sold

  - the wholesale price $w_{t}$ she had to pay for a big box of ice cream from the wholesale store

- You are a young consultant who shall help Bob to optimize his ice cream business. How would you proceed to find an optimal pricing rule?

#. frame A model of the data generating process with a profit-maximizing firm

- We now present a simple model:

  - Downward sloping demand function, with random demand shocks
  
  - Firm sets profit maximizing prices
  
  - We can find a positive relationship between prices and output.

#. frame Demand Function

- The sales in period $t$ shall be given by the following demand function $$q_{t}=a_{t}-bp_{t}$$

  - The market size parameter $a_{t}$ shall be given by $$a_{t}=a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}$$

  - $\varepsilon_{t}$ is a random variable that measures a “demand shock” in period $t$.

  - Example: Good weather -> higher $\varepsilon$
  
  - The demand shock shall not be influenced by the price (but the price may depend on $\varepsilon$)

  - $b$ and $a_{0}$ are exogenously given numerical parameters with $$a_{0}>0\mbox{ and }b>0$$

#. frame Profit Maximization

- The firm’s profits shall be given by $$\pi_{t}=p_{t}q_{t}-c_{t}q_{t} - F$$

  - $c_{t}\geq0$ is a constant marginal cost of production in period $t$ (cost of one portion of ice cream)
  - $F$ are some fixed costs that don't depend on the price.

- Assume the firm knows in each period $t$ its cost $c_{t}$, the demand shock $\varepsilon_{t}$ and the parameters $a_{0}$ and $b$ in period $t$ and chooses a price $p_{t}$ that maximizes its expected profits.

#. frame Optimal Prices and Corresponding Output

Exercise: Show that the profit-maximizing price and corresponding sold quanitity are given by: 
$$p^*_{t} = \frac{a_0+\varepsilon_t}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}$$ and
$$q^*_{t} = \frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2}-\frac{b c_{t}}{2}$$

#< note Solution

The optimal price $p^*_t$ maximizes the profit function.

$$\begin{align*}
\pi(p_t) & = q_t(p_t)(p-c_{t}) - F\\
 & =(a_{t}-bp_t)(p_t-c_{t}) - F\\
 & =a_{t}p-a_{t}c_t-bp_t^{2}+bp_tc_{t} - F
\end{align*}$$

The first order condition is given by
$$\begin{align*}
\pi'(p_t^*) =& a_t-2bp_t^*+bc_t = 0 \Leftrightarrow \\
& p_t^* = \frac{a_{t}}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}
\end{align*}$$

If we plug in $a_t=a_0+\varepsilon_t$, we get
$$\begin{align*}
p^*_{t} & =\frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}
\end{align*}$$

We get the equilibrium quantity as

$$\begin{align*}
q^*_{t} & = a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t} - b p_t^* \\
        & = \frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2}-\frac{b c_{t}}{2}
\end{align*}$$

#. frame Simulating the model in R

- To get intuition about this economic model, we want to simulate in R.

- Here and in other places I will show you some R code in the class and the steps are roughly described in the slides.

- You will repeat similar steps in more detail in the corresponding RTutor problem sets (here the problem set for Chapter 1a).
  - For that reason you won't get the R code from class. Look at the RTutor problem set instead.

#. frame Simulating the model in R

- Open a new R script in RStudio and write a program that numerically simulates the model above

  - Choose some values for the parameters $a_{0}>0$ and $b>0$ and pick a total number of periods $T$

  - Assume demand shocks are independently, identically normally distributed with standard deviation $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$ $$\varepsilon_{t}\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2})$$

  - Assume costs $c_{t}$ are uniformely distributed on an interval.

  - Compute the values of $q$ and $p$ for each period and show a scatter plot of both variables.

#. frame Analysing the Model with Simulation and Theory

- Is the plotted relationship between prices and quantity just a noisy version of the demand curve?

- Try to find parameter constellations such that prices are positively correlated with sold quantities.

- Why can prices be positively correlated with sold quantities? Try to explain intuitively.

- Study with your simulation how the correlation between $q$ and $p$ changes if you reduce the standard deviation of the demand shocks $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$ to a very small value.

#. frame Insights from the analysis so far

- It is really useful to think about how a data set is created: Form a model about the data generating process!

- A positive correlation between prices and output does not imply that higher prices *cause* higher output.

  - A positive *correlation* can arise if prices are set systematically higher in markets with high demand.

- Here, the observed *relationship* between prices and output is *not* a noisy version of a demand function.

- The demand function describes how, ceteris paribus, higher prices *cause* lower quantities sold.

- To set profit maximizing prices it would be really helpful to estimate such a demand function.

#. frame A pricing experiment to find the demand function

- You convinced Bob that the data could have been generated by the model described above. He asks you to estimate the the demand function.

- You propose a “randomized pricing experiment”

  - Bob shall choose for $T$ periods in each period $t$ some randomly selected price $p_{t}$ and observe the resulting sales $q_{t}$

#. frame R Simulation of Pricing Experiment

(You do this in the corresponding RTutor problem set)

- Adapt your R code such that prices are now randomly selected.

- Plot the resulting relationship between $p$ and $q$. Does it look like a noisy version of the demand curve?

#. frame Estimating the demand function

- Use the R function lm (stands for linear model) to estimate the following linear regression model of the demand function 
$$\begin{align*}
q_{t}=&\beta_{0}&+&\beta_{1}p_{t}&+\varepsilon_{t} \\
     (=& a_0   &+& (-b)p_t & +\varepsilon_{t})    
\end{align*}$$
via ordinary least squares (OLS).

  - Compare the true values of $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ with the OLS estimates.

  - Does the OLS estimator seem to be **consistent** in the sense that the estimated coefficients are close to to their true values when we have a very large number $T$ of observations? (We will formally define consistency later)

- Repeat the previous exercise for the case that the data is generated by the model with profit maximizing prices.

#. frame What have we done so far?

- **Policy Question:** We want to find a rule to set profit maximizing prices for Bob’s ice cream business.

- **Model for decision:** We discussed how to set profit maximizing prices based on an economic model with a downward sloping “demand function”. To find optimal prices, we need to know / estimate a demand function for ice cream.

- **Data:** We got a historical data set of prices and output. Interestingly, prices are positively correlated with quantity sold.

- **Model of data generating process:** We wrote down and studied a simple model of how the data could have been generated. Similar to our decision model, we assume the model has a downward sloping demand function and prices have been set in a profit maximizing fashion. Importantly, there are also random demand shocks $\varepsilon$ (incorporating conditions like weather) that have been known by the price setter.

#. frame What have we done so far?

- **Simulation:** To get better intuition about the data generating process, we simulated it in R.

  - We found that the model can indeed generate a positive correlation between equilibrium prices and output, even though the demand function is downward sloping. The reason is that positive demand shocks increase both prices and output.

  - We also simulated an alternative model in which prices are set randomly.

- **Estimation:** We estimated a linear regression of our demand function with the simulated data.

  - When prices were set randomly, it looked as if we had a consistent estimator of the true parameters of the demand function

  - When prices were set in a profit maximizing fashion, our estimator of the demand function was inconsistent.

#. frame What will we do next?

1\.  We will review some basic concepts of econometrics, focusing on the linear regession model

  - Key idea in econometrics: there is a true model with random variables that generated the data.

  - Econometric tools, like estimation procedures or statistical tests, only make sense if the model satisfies certain conditions.

  - We study some important tools and concepts.

2\.  We will study instrumental variable (IV) estimation

  - IV estimation is a very prominent method to consistently estimate coefficients in cases in which OLS estimation does not work.

  - IV estimation will allow us to consistently estimate the demand function for our example data set, in which prices have not been set randomly.

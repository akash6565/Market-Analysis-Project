### Profit maximization of a multi-product firm

#. youtube id="ShLJ95LDMxo", file="3b 1.mp4"

#< quiz "cross_price_effect"
question: |
  Which sign would we expect for the cross price derivative $\frac{\partial q_{2}(p)}{\partial p_1}$ for two car models?
sc:
  - Negative
  - Zero
  - Positive*

#. youtube id="dAuIhpkglSg", file="3b 2.mp4"

#< quiz "flexible"
question: |
  Can the conditional logit with product attributes as explanatory variables well model flexible substitution patterns? Make a guess.
sc:
  - Yes, given a well designed choice experiment.
  - No, the substitition patterns will always be very limited.*

#< quiz "sports_family"
question: |
  For which car type will a conditional logit model predict a higher increase in the absolute demand if the price of sports car A increases (see video above)?
sc:
  - For sports car B
  - For family car C*
  - The absolute demand increase will be the same for B and C.

#< quiz "blue_bus"
question: |
  Which choice probabilities will the conditional logit model predict when we introduce the blue bus?
sc:
  - The car, red bus and blue bus will each be chosen with probaility 1/3.*
  - The car will be chosen with probability 1/2 and the blue bus and red bus with probability 1/4 each.
  - The car will be chosen with probability 1/2 and we don't know the choice probabilities of each bus type.

### Two consumer types

#. youtube id="Tsf1S_-FcOU", file="3b 6 Two consumer groups.mp4"


#< quiz "two_types"
question: |
  Will the model with two consumer types have the effect that a price increase of sports car A has a bigger impact on sports car B than on family car C?
sc:
  - Yes*
  - No

### The mixed logit model

That's all. Look at the RTutor problem set 3b to study an application of mixed logit models.
